# Arduino
This repository contains various Arduino Libraries primarily developed for Positron Arduino Shields. We have tried to make the libraries flexible enough so that newbies as well as experienced users can use them with ease.

For using the libraries please copy them in the following address in your system:-
      
                <arduino-install directory>/libraries
                
Your valuable feedback and suggestions are always welcome. If you find any discrepencies in libraries please make it to our notice and we will try to resolve it as soon as possible.
